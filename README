WFM - Web File Manager
======================
WFM is a web file management application. It allows to upload, download,
rename, delete files and organize directory / folder structure using a
standard web browser with CGI.

This program is written using portable C code and compiles natively
for many flavors of Unix. The output is a pure W3C certified HTML 4.01
and doesn't require JavaScript support in the browser. WFM will work in
most HTTP 1.1 web servers with CGI support.  Due to compact size and
lightning fast execution time it's ideal for small and embedded systems.


History
=======
WFM has been conceived around 1994 as a perl cgi script for CERN httpd
server to allow uploading data files by field support engineers. Later 
rewritten in C language, when CGIC library and Apache httpd were released
around 1996. Up to 2015 WFM has been a closed source commercial application,
supported by a few large enterprise and smaller corporation users. WFM is
now released as open source.


Installation
============
WFM binary is self contained including all icons/images. You only need
to copy the compiled wfm binary (with any name) to your cgi execution
directory. Include a config file of the same name as the binary file plus
.cfg extension. Example:

/u/foo/web/cgi-bin
  wfm
  wfm.cfg

Edit the cfg file according to your needs.

Point your browser to http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/wfm and you are done.
